Top-level summary of mice identified with squamous cell carcinoma treated with capomulin and other treatment regimens.

Analyse includes:

Cleaning data to remove redundances.

Creating a summary statistics table of each drug regimen and their tumor volume (mm3).

Creating bar charts of each drug regimen and their total number of time points recorded.

Creating pie charts to visulize the female/male mouse ratio.

Calculated and created a whisker box plot of four specific regimens versus their final tumor volume (mm3).

Created a line graph of time points (days) vs. tumor volume (mm3) of a mouse treated with Capomulin.

Created a scatter plot of the weights of mice versus their average tumor volume (mm3) undergoing Capomulin treatments. The 
correlation between these two sets was calculated and linear regression was also done on these sets.

Three observations are noted at the top of the notebook.
